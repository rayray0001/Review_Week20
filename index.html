						The movie Disney's: <i>The Avengers</i> was released in 2012, and was produced by Marvel Studios, with distribution provided by the Walt Disney Studios. The film was directed by Joss Whedon, who has written and directed several TV shows and movies, such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Firefly and Much Ado About Nothing. Based on the origin story of the Avengers in Marvel comics, this movie has a massive cast. The film stars <b>Robert Downey Jr.</b>, <b>Scarlett Johansson</b>, <b>Mark Ruffalo</b>, <b>Chris Hemsworth</b>, <b>Tom Hiddleston</b>, <b>Chris Evans</b> and <b>Samuel L. Jackson</b>. The villain, Loki, the Norse God of Mischief has come to Earth in order to conquer it for an unknown alien race. Iron Man and Captain America were the first to respond. Meeting on the battlefield for the first time, there is a misunderstanding. After a short fight, they manage to capture Loki. While transporting Loki back to the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Lokiâ€™s brother, Thor, attempts to capture Loki for himself to bring him to justice in Asgard, their own realm. Thor, Captain America and Iron Man fight until they realize they are after the same thing. The Hulk, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America are at the S.H.I.E.L.D.base when it is attacked. The team works together for the first time and manage to save the floating Helicarrier base, but in the process Loki escapes, and launches an attack on New York City. The Avengers assemble to defeat the alien invasion, but Iron Man nearly had to sacrifice himself to do so. Loki is then escorted back to their own realm by Thor.</p>

					<h3>The Good:</h3>
					<p class="article_paragraph">
						The special effects in this movie are fantastic. Characters like Iron Man and the Hulk, as well as the alien invaders are rendered so convincingly that it is hard to tell that they are computer generated effects. The acting is fantastic, with each actor portraying their character just as convincingly as the special effects portray the Hulk. The script is great as well, with just the right amount of comedy and drama. Director Joss Whedon manages to give each character in this gigantic cast a chance to shine, which could not have been easy. The film crew also managed to portray each comic book character well and true to their source.</p>

						<h3>The Bad:</h3>
					<p class="article_paragraph">
					There is not all that much wrong with The Avengers. If anything, it is not that deep of a movie. It is a big fun summer action movie and not all that much else.</p>



					<h3>The Verdict:</h3>
					<p class="article_paragraph">
					 Disney's The Avengers is a movie that everyone should see. As a shining example of the excellent parts current cinema, it has something for everyone. The Avengers is the product of several movies that belong to a shared movie universe that does not seem to be slowing down anytime soon. For further adventures of The Avengers, the sequel <i>The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron</i> was announced recently which continues the story. <i>Thor  2: The Dark work</i> comes out in 2013, <i>Captain America 2</i> comes out in 2014 and a new TV series, <i>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>premiered September 24, 2013.</p>
